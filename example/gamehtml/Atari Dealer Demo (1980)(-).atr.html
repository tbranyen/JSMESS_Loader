<b>The Atari Dealer Demo</b>
<p>
This demo requires no user input to run (however, it does optionally take your name to give you
a personalized pitch at various points). It is intended to run on an Atari computer at a store, 
and walks through the many potential uses and qualities of the Atari 8-bit line of machines. it
is one of the earliest "demo" programs in existence, utilizing all sorts of variant programming
to show off the machine.
